<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, a full installation is not possible now, because this application is not posted in the AppStore. But if you really want to try it, then you should:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Download this repository to your Mac (it wonâ€™t work with Windows)</li>
  <li>Install Xcode, using the AppStore</li>
  <li>Open the downloaded repository in Xcode</li>
  <li>Connect your iOS device to Mac and select it in the list of simulators</li>
  <li>Run the project</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This application will appear on your iPhone, but after about 7 days it will be blocked and you will have to reconnect the iPhone and run the project again</p>
